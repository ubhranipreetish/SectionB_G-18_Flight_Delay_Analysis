## Business Problem

Airline operations managers and aviation regulators are struggling to identify the root causes of flight delays and cancellations across routes.

**Core Business Question**

Which airlines, routes, seasons and delay causes are driving the worst on time performance?

**Decision Supported**

This analysis will enable airline operations managers to prioritise which delay causes, routes and carriers require targeted intervention.

## KPI Framework

| KPI | Definition | Formula / Computation |
|---|---|---|
| _e.g. Monthly Revenue Growth %_ | _What business outcome this tracks_ | _Show the exact formula or notebook reference_ |
| _e.g. Customer Churn Rate_ | _What business outcome this tracks_ | _Show the exact formula or notebook reference_ |
| _e.g. Repeat Purchase Rate_ | _What business outcome this tracks_ | _Show the exact formula or notebook reference_ |

| KPI | Definition | Formula / Computation |
|---|---|---|
| On Time Arrival Rate (%) | Measures the percentage of flights that arrive on time | (Flights where ARR_DELAY ≤ 15 mins ÷ Total Flights) × 100 |
| Flight Cancellation Rate (%) | Tracks the proportion of scheduled flights that were cancelled | (Cancelled Flights ÷ Total Scheduled Flights) × 100 |
| Average Arrival Delay | Calculates the average delay duration for flights that arrived late | Mean of ARR_DELAY for all delayed flights (ARR_DELAY > 0) |

## Analytical Pipeline

The project follows a structured 7 step workflow:

1. **Define** - Sector selected, problem statement scoped, mentor approval obtained.
2. **Extract** - Raw dataset sourced and committed to `data/raw/`; data dictionary drafted.
3. **Clean and Transform** - Cleaning pipeline built in `notebooks/02_cleaning.ipynb` and optionally `scripts/etl_pipeline.py`.
4. **Analyze** - EDA and statistical analysis performed in notebooks `03` and `04`.
5. **Visualize** - Interactive Tableau dashboard built and published on Tableau Public.
6. **Recommend** - 3-5 data-backed business recommendations delivered.
7. **Report** - Final project report and presentation deck completed and exported to PDF in `reports/`.
